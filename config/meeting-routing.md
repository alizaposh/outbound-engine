# Config: Meeting Routing

Who a booked meeting belongs to, and the link used to book it. **Read this instead of
hardcoding a name.** `instructions/reply-handling.md` drives interested replies to a
meeting; the person and link come from here, so changing the owner is a config edit in
one place rather than a search across instruction files.

## Meeting owner (single)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Zach Hickman |
| Role | SDR |
| Booking link | `https://meetings.hubspot.com/zach-hickman` |

- **One owner in v1.** Every meeting from every sender persona lands with Zach. There
  is no round-robin and no territory split.
- **The booking link is a HubSpot meetings link**, so a booking made through it lands
  natively in HubSpot — which is what lets the native "Date of last meeting booked in
  meetings tool" property carry the date, per the v1 meeting-tracking decision in
  `config/hubspot-properties.md`. A non-HubSpot scheduler would break that.
- **Never paste a booking link into an opener.** Per `config/personas.md`, both
  personas open reply-based; a scheduling link appears only after the prospect shows
  interest.

## Sender personas vs meeting owner

These are different things and the distinction drives the open question below.

- **12 mailboxes across 4 warmed domains** (`vibeposhvip.com`, `coreposhvip.com`,
  `poshvippulse.com`, `poshviphub.com`).
- **Zach holds 3 of them.** The other **9 are separate sender personas** — a different
  human name signs those emails (mailbox → sign-off mapping in `config/senders.md`).
- So for 9 of 12 mailboxes, the person who sent the cold email is **not** the person
  who takes the meeting. That handoff needs a defined shape.

## Handoff model: persona-fronted, Zach-owned (decided 2026-08-21)

The sending persona stays the correspondent; the meeting belongs to Zach.

- **The sending persona remains the thread correspondent.** Whoever's name signs the
  cold email keeps signing the replies. There is **no automatic mid-thread identity
  swap** — the engine never silently substitutes one human for another in a live thread.
- **On `interested` and `question` replies, the persona shares Zach's booking link.**
  The meeting lands on Zach's calendar even though a different persona is writing.
- **Substantive live conversations escalate to Zach** via human review. He decides, per
  thread, whether to introduce himself. That judgment is deliberately his and not the
  handler's: whether a mid-thread introduction reads as a natural handoff or as a
  bait-and-switch depends on the specific conversation.
- **This applies to all 12 mailboxes**, including Zach's own 3. On his mailboxes the
  correspondent and the meeting owner simply happen to be the same person, so no
  escalation-for-identity is needed — only the normal escalation for a substantive
  conversation.

What the reply handler does with this: draft the reply in the persona's voice, include
the meeting owner's booking link from this file, and flag the thread for Zach once the
conversation goes beyond a first reply.

## Consumers

- `instructions/reply-handling.md` — the action map's "drive to a meeting" actions.
- `config/personas.md` — CTA guidance ("scheduling link once interested").
- `config/senders.md` — mailbox → sign-off name, which decides whether a given thread
  is a Zach mailbox or one of the 9.
